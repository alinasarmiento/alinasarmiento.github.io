Back in 2021 I made a zine! Inspired by the experiences of my family and others in my community, _Carried_ is a short collection of four illustrated poems about immigration, inter-generational trauma, and Asian American identity. Carried specifically explores the mother-child bond, what it means to leave a place, and the things that we carry with us.
