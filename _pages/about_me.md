I'm a senior at MIT (class of 2024) studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Learning Machines and Physical Systems. I'm also minoring in math.[^1] Currently an undergrad researcher (UROP) under Sangbae Kim with the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) in the MIT MechE department.

My main interests are in **intelligent robotic manipulation**: I think a necessary part of bringing robots to the real world is allowing them to interact with their environment in interesting and dynamic ways, even if they are uncertain or uninformed about their surroundings (or about themselves!).

Specifically, I want to enable robots to **plan through complex contact** (non-prehensile and whole-body contact, dynamic uses of friction, exploitation of object deformation, tool use, etc) in **unmodeled and cluttered scenes**, in a way that is robust and deployable across robot hardware.

[^1]: in MIT-speak, i'm Course 2-A/6+LMPS, 18 minor, concentration in 21G (Japanese). phew!

**Outside of school,** I dabble in various art forms (talk to me about painting, comics, mending, and puppetry!). At MIT I am involved in the music and [acapella](http://resonance.mit.edu/?p=home) scene.

After undergrad, I'll be starting my PhD at UPenn's GRASP Lab advised by Michael Posa. I'm lucky to be supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

## engineering/research interests
- relationship between robot morphology and task/motion affordances
- contact-rich, non-prehensile, and whole-body robotic manipulation
- planning under uncertainty and robust perception
- contact dynamics-informed learning and control
- data efficient learning
- mechanics of contact, mechanics of the continua, and mechanical fatigue
- **applications:** ecological surveying and intervention, assistive home, unstructured warehouse work, emergency response

## other passions
- education accessibility / access to STEM
- public access to research, the open source movement
- housing and healthcare equity + the politics of displacement
- environmental justice and sustainability
- queer and intersectional studies ([see my current reading list](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/list/share/1900259209_alinasarmiento/1900265989_queer_literature))

I currently live in Cambridge, Massachusetts but I come from Newark, California in the SF Bay Area. I'm okay with any pronouns, but I tend to go by they/them. I am a serial sock mismatcher.
