[Hello there!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)

I am a senior at MIT studying mechanical engineering + robotics. Currently working on deep learning for robotic manipulation with the [Improbable AI Lab](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) at MIT CSAIL and on bipedal robotic control policies with the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) in the MIT MechE department.

My main academic interests are in intelligent robotic manipulation and environment use under uncertainty. Other than that, I do art, comics, and music, and have passions in education and research accessibility.

If your carrier pigeon is on holiday, I can be found by email at <div class="more-info">alinasar [at] mit [dot] edu</div>. Come say hi!
